# Inventory-Management-System-With-Dataforcasting

# 1 Introduction

The primary aim of this project is to seamlessly integrate inventory management and
demand forecasting within the supply chain framework. By leveraging cutting-edge technologies and methodologies, the project endeavors to optimize inventory levels, enhance
supply chain efficiency, and accurately predict demand patterns. The overarching goal is to
minimize stockouts, reduce excess inventory, improve resource allocation, and ultimately
elevate overall operational performance within the supply chain through the harmonized
application of inventory management and demand forecasting techniques.‚Äù

# 3 Features
1 )Inventory Tracking:
 
The system must allow users to track and manage inventory items,
including adding, updating, and deleting items. It should maintain information like item
name, description, SKU, quantity on hand, supplier details, and purchase history. Inventory Visibility: Real-time Tracking: Utilize technologies such as barcode scanning, RFID
(Radio Frequency Identification), or IoT (Internet of Things) sensors to track inventory
movements and updates instantly. Location Tracking: Maintain accurate records of where
each item is stored within warehouses, distribution centers, or retail stores. Multi-location
Management: Monitor inventory across multiple locations or facilities, including regional
warehouses or store branches.

2)Real-Time Updates:

Inventory levels should be updated in real-time to reflect sales,
returns, and restocking

3)Visualization:

Provide tools for visualizing historical data and forecasted demand,
such as line charts and graphs Overview: The system shall include visualization tools that
enable users to view historical data and forecasted demand in graphical formats, including line charts and graphs. These tools will provide users with intuitive ways to analyze
trends, patterns, and fluctuations over time.

4)Graphical Representation: 

Line Charts: Implement line charts to display historical
data and forecasted demand over a selected time period. Each line should represent a
specific data series, such as actual sales versus projected demand. Bar Graphs: Use bar
graphs where applicable, allowing users to compare categorical data (e.g., demand by
product category) over time.

5)Authorization and Access Control:

Based on the information in the JWT payload,
your server determines whether the user is authorized to access the requested resource
or perform the requested action. This allows you to enforce fine-grained access control
throughout your application.
